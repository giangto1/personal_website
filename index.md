<h1>Career Objectives</h1>
Hello, I'm Giang To! I recently graduated from the University of Minnesota with a Bachelor's degree in Data Science. As I begin this next chapter, I’m actively exploring opportunities in Data and Analytics, including roles in Business Analytics, Product Analytics, Data Engineering, and Data Science.

During my time in college, I not only focused on academics and building meaningful connections but also sought out hands-on experiences through research, competitions, and internships to deepen my practical skills in working with data.

During my senior year, I was a research assistant in the Statistics department to investigate the applications of newly created algorithms to solve Network Lasso problems, with benchmarking against more traditional and general optimal convex solvers such as Python's CVXPY library. 

In the past, I was a Data Analyst Intern at Colorado State University - Forest and Rangeland Department, where I worked to analyse 300K forest fires data points across the San Bernandino mountain range to develop land care and forest fire preventation strategies.

<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>
Outside of continuously learning and growing, I’ve spent my time in my 20s finding balance through exercise and travel. I enjoy weight training, running, and other cardio activities — they help me clear my mind and manage stress. I also love exploring the world and seeing places I once only read about in books or saw online. Traveling gives me a deeper sense of connection and curiosity about the world around me.
</p>

<h1>A few fun facts</h1>
<ul>
<li> I love coffee more than matcha </li>
<li> My dream is to teach coding or data science in Vietnam </li>
<li> I sit at random buildings to work </li>
</ul>

Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Giang, and I am a young, fun, and professional Data Analyst who is doing her best every day!
